# Multi-Expert Team Architecture - Integration Guide

## Overview

This project implements a **multi-expert team architecture** where different experts specialize in specific domains (frontend, backend, AI services) and coordinate with each other to deliver high-quality, integrated solutions.

## Expert Team Structure

### Frontend Experts (Project Repository)
- **frontend-design-expert**: UI/UX design, component architecture, Tailwind CSS + CSS variables
- **frontend-code-quality**: TypeScript, performance optimization, accessibility
- **frontend-state-management**: Redux patterns, local state, data flow
- **frontend-integration**: API calls, error handling, loading states
- **webapp-testing**: React testing patterns, component testing
- **accessibility-i18n**: A11y implementation, internationalization

### Backend Experts (Backend Repository)
- **backend-api-expert**: REST API design, Express.js architecture, error handling
- **ai-rag-expert**: RAG architecture, document processing, AI service integration
- **api-security**: JWT/role guard patterns, authentication, authorization
- **backend-testing**: Jest + ESM + Mongoose mock patterns
- **database-patterns**: Mongoose schema design, N+1 prevention, query optimization
- **deployment-ops**: Render deployment, Winston logging config

### Cross-Service Integration
- **cross-service-integration**: Service coordination, API contracts, data flow validation

## How to Use the Multi-Expert Team

### Step 1: Identify Your Task Type

Before starting any task, identify which expert(s) you need:

| Task Type | Primary Expert | Secondary Experts |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Create new UI component | frontend-design-expert | frontend-code-quality, cross-service-integration |
| Implement API endpoint | backend-api-expert | api-security, database-patterns |
| Integrate AI service | ai-rag-expert | backend-api-expert, cross-service-integration |
| Add authentication | api-security | backend-api-expert, frontend-integration |
| Optimize performance | frontend-code-quality | backend-api-expert |
| Implement state management | frontend-state-management | frontend-design-expert |

### Step 2: Load the Appropriate Expert Skill

Use the `skill` tool to load the expert skill before starting your task:

```bash
# Example: Load frontend design expert
skill name="frontend-design-expert"

# Example: Load backend API expert
skill name="backend-api-expert"

# Example: Load AI RAG expert
skill name="ai-rag-expert"

# Example: Load cross-service integration
skill name="cross-service-integration"
```

### Step 3: Follow Expert Workflow

Each expert skill provides a specific workflow. Follow it step-by-step:

#### Frontend Design Expert Workflow
1. Load `frontend-design-expert` skill
2. Review component patterns and Tailwind CSS + CSS variables usage
3. Use `semantic_search_nodes` to find similar components
4. Design component following established patterns
5. Validate with `cross-service-integration` for API contracts

#### Backend API Expert Workflow
1. Load `backend-api-expert` skill
2. Review API contracts in `shared-contracts/api-definitions.md`
3. Use `semantic_search_nodes` to find similar endpoints
4. Design endpoint following RESTful conventions
5. Validate with `cross-service-integration` expert

#### AI RAG Expert Workflow
1. Load `ai-rag-expert` skill
2. Review AI service patterns and requirements
3. Use `query_graph` to find existing AI integrations
4. Implement AI service integration with proper error handling
5. Validate with `backend-api-expert` for endpoint design

### Step 4: Use MCP Tools for Code Analysis

Before writing code, use MCP tools to understand the existing codebase:

```bash
# Find similar components/endpoints
code-review-graph_semantic_search_nodes_tool query="user authentication"

# Understand code relationships
code-review-graph_query_graph_tool pattern="callers_of" target="functionName"

# Check impact of changes
code-review-graph_get_impact_radius_tool changed_files=["path/to/file"]

# Find affected flows
code-review-graph_get_affected_flows_tool changed_files=["path/to/file"]
```

### Step 5: Coordinate Between Experts

For tasks that span multiple domains, coordinate between experts:

```bash
# Example: Frontend-Backend Integration
1. Load frontend-design-expert → Design UI component
2. Load cross-service-integration → Review API contracts
3. Load backend-api-expert → Validate endpoint design
4. Implement with guidance from all experts

# Example: Backend-AI Integration
1. Load backend-api-expert → Design API endpoint
2. Load ai-rag-expert → Design AI integration
3. Load cross-service-integration → Validate data flow
4. Implement with guidance from all experts
```

## Expert Coordination Commands

Use these commands to coordinate between experts:

### Frontend to Backend
- "Ask backend-api-expert about API contract for user authentication"
- "Validate this data model with backend-api-expert"
- "Coordinate error handling with backend-api-expert"

### Backend to Frontend
- "Ask frontend-design-expert about data format requirements"
- "Validate this response format with frontend-design-expert"
- "Coordinate loading states with frontend-design-expert"

### Backend to AI
- "Ask ai-rag-expert about document upload requirements"
- "Validate this AI integration with ai-rag-expert"
- "Coordinate error handling with ai-rag-expert"

### Cross-Service Validation
- "Validate this integration with cross-service-integration"
- "Check data flow between services with cross-service-integration"
- "Review API contracts with cross-service-integration"

## Shared Contracts

The `shared-contracts/` directory contains shared resources:

### data-models.ts
Shared TypeScript interfaces for all data models:
- User models (User, UserProfile, StudentProfile, TeacherProfile)
- API response models (APIResponse, PaginatedResponse)
- Content models (Subject, Chapter, Content)
- Question models (Question, QuestionPaper)
- Progress models (Progress, QuizAttempt)
- AI service models (AIDocument, AIQuery, AIRequest, AIResponse)
- And more...

### api-definitions.md
Complete API documentation with:
- Base URLs and authentication
- Common response formats
- All API endpoints with request/response examples
- Error codes and rate limiting
- Webhook events

**Always reference these files when implementing new features or API integrations.**

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Load Expert Skills First
Before starting any task, load the appropriate expert skill to get guidance on patterns, best practices, and workflows.

### 2. Use MCP Tools Before File Exploration
Always use `code-review-graph` tools before using Grep/Glob/Read to explore the codebase. The graph provides structural context that file scanning cannot.

### 3. Validate with Cross-Service Integration
For any task that involves multiple services, validate with `cross-service-integration` to ensure proper data flow and error handling.

### 4. Reference Shared Contracts
Always reference `shared-contracts/` files when implementing new features or API integrations to ensure consistency across services.

### 5. Coordinate Between Experts
For tasks that span multiple domains, coordinate between experts to ensure all aspects are covered.

### 6. Follow Expert Workflows
Each expert skill provides a specific workflow. Follow it step-by-step to ensure quality and consistency.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Expert Skill Not Loading
**Solution**: Ensure the skill file exists in `.agent/skills/` directory and has the correct structure.

### Issue: MCP Tools Not Working
**Solution**: Ensure the code-review-graph is built and up-to-date. Run `code-review-graph_build_or_update_graph_tool` if needed.

### Issue: Cross-Service Integration Failing
**Solution**: Validate API contracts in `shared-contracts/api-definitions.md` and ensure data models match between services.

### Issue: Expert Coordination Confusion
**Solution**: Use the expert coordination commands to clarify responsibilities and validate decisions.

## Continuous Improvement
